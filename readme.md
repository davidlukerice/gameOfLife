Conway's Game of Life Challenge

For the purposes of this project we will use this one http://jsfiddle.net/blesh/n9S8R/light/ as an example.

Challenge:
  - [x] Step button
  - [x] Conwayâ€™s standard set of 4 rules:
    1. < 2 live neighbors dies
    2. 2 or 3 live neighbors lives
    3. > 3 live neighbors dies
    4. dead cell === 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell
  - [x] User can define the height and width
  - [x] Color
    - [x] Color picker for initial value
    - [x] Inherit color from parents.
    Starting with the cell to its left and moving clockwise, it takes the R value from the leftmost parent, the G value from the next parent, and the B value from the third parent. Since new cells are only born when they have exactly 3 of their 8 neighbor cells populated, this works cleanly.
  - [x] Model the maturity of each cell with opacity.
    - [x] opacity will start at 0.1
    - [x] increase by 0.1 each cycle of the game it survives to 1
  - [x] Play/Pause buttons
  - [x] Clear the board button
  - [x] Random button
  - [x] Speed Slider
  - [x] Fix color insertion bug (picks up from dead tiles?)
  - [x] Pen size slider
  - [ ] Make more robust / modular (for easier extension)
  - [ ] Put back in jsFiddle and send link
